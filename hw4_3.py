# Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers.
# If the number is below zero, the program should print out the message "Invalid number".
# If the number is above zero, the program should print out the square root of the number using the Python sqrt function.
# In either case, the program should then keep asking for another number.
# If the user inputs the number zero, the program should stop asking for numbers and print "Exiting".
# Sample output is shown below:
