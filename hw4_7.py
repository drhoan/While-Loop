# Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
# Write a program that checks if the number is a prime number.
# If the number is a prime number, the program should return True.
# If the number is not a prime number, the program should return False.
# Hint: you can use for loop and modulus operator.
